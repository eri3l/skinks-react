# skinks-web-react

This earlier version runs live, but has not been updated with latest changes:
https://skinks-nz.web.app/

Before you running, do:
```
npm install 
```
to install all project dependencies specified in package.json file. 
Whenever you need a new dependent JS library which does something useful, 
it needs to be added into package.json and above command needs
to be re-run.

With above in place you can run the app locally using
```
npm start
```
To deploy:
```
npm run-script build
```

The UI is built using Material UI components which is built on top of React
